### Part 1 ###

#### To run: ####

1. Run `./dbsetup` to install and configure Neo4j - enter root password if prompted
2. If `antlr-python-runtime` is not installed, run `./clientsetup`
3. Run `./client` to launch client

#### Included: ####
1. Neo4j:
    * Script to install and configure Neo4j and execute sample queries from `Client\cypher-parser-lexer\queries\test.txt` in the Cypher-shell

2. ANTLR:
    * Python lexer and parser generated by ANTLR

3. Client(Part 1):
    * Accepts cypher queries as user input, passes through the lexer and parser, and displays on screen
    * Error message shown if not parsed properly

Note: 
1. Refactoring of the entire `project` directory will be done when all components are added
2. Client interface functionality will be updated as more tasks need to be performed

### Part 2 ###

#### To run: ####

1. Run `./serversetup` to install neo4j dependency for Go
2. Run `./server` to run the server
3. Run `./client` to launch client

#### Included: ####
1. Server(Part 1, Part 2):
    * Runs preselected queries from `Client\cypher-parser-lexer\queries` on Neo4j
    * Accepts query from client and runs it on Neo4j

2. Client(Part 2):
    * If query is valid, sends a request to server with the query

3. Visualizer(Smalltalk):
    * Implemented Node and Edge classes using Morph superclass
    * Can read graph from json string or file in the filesystem
    * Node and Edge properties are populated - visualization has not been implemented yet

Note: 
1. Client waits for server response, which is not implemented yet - exception is thrown always on clientside
2. There were issues with pushing Smalltalk code to GitHub - for now they are included in the Visualizer directory, this will be changed for the final version of the project

### Part 3 ###

#### To run: ####

#### Included: ####
1. Server(Part 3):
    * Packages result into JSON and sends to client as Response

2. Client(Part 3):
    * Receives Response from server 
    * Saves to JSON file as well as local SQLite DB

3. Visualizer(OCaml):
    * Reads result from JSON file and displays in tabular form

4. Benchmark:
    * 50 Cypher queries exectured 100 times each, average execution time stored

Note:
1. No script to run OCaml visualizer
